## 🎯 What is FitPulse?

**FitPulse** is an AI-powered fitness and health platform that combines **real-time posture correction, workout safety, nutrition analysis, and wellness intelligence** into one unified system.

Unlike traditional fitness apps that only track workouts, FitPulse focuses on **safe, adaptive, and preventive wellness**, running **directly in the browser with no paid APIs required**.

---

## ❗ Problem We Address

Today’s fitness and health ecosystem is fragmented:

* Fitness apps don’t correct posture → injuries happen
* No safety system for people exercising alone at home
* Nutrition labels are confusing for everyday users
* Workouts are generic and ignore stress or fatigue
* Users juggle multiple apps for fitness, food, and health

This leads to unsafe workouts, burnout, and poor health decisions.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**FitPulse brings fitness, health, nutrition, and safety together in one AI-driven platform.**

We focus on:

* Correct exercise posture and injury prevention
* Emergency safety during solo workouts
* Simple nutrition understanding using AI
* Stress-adaptive workout recommendations
* Preventive health awareness instead of reactive care
